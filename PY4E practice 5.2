'''
5.2 Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the
user enters 'done'. Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of 
the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a 
try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the number. Enter 7, 2, bob,
10, and 4 and match the output below.

    try:
        i_num = int(num)
